# Tensor-Flow-Project--2--

<table>
  
**In this project we'll be solving the regression problem. Here we will solving the multi classification problem by classifying the image to different categories in Fashion_MNIST_Dataset using different features using TensorFlow..** <br></br>


**Let's looks into dataset and categories of it:** <br></br>

**About Dataset**: <br>
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. <br>

** Please go through the image to know about different categories or classes.

**Before jumping to the code lets understand what is TensorFlow and What do you mean by classification problem?**...<br></br>

**What is a TensorFlow?** <br></br>

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. It was developed by the Google Brain team for Google's internal use in research and production. <br></br>

**What is a Classification?** <br></br>

Classification is a supervised machine learning process of categorizing a given set of input data into classes based on one or more variables. <br></br>

**Important Note: Before Jumping to the code go through this git hub link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/master/insurance.csv to learn about the dataset.**
