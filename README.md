# Tensor-Flow-Project--1--

<table>
  
**In this project we'll be solving the regression problem. Here we will solving the multi classification problem by classifying the image to different categories in Fashion_MNIST_Dataset using different features using TensorFlow..** <br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand what is TensorFlow and What do you mean by classification problem?**...<br></br>

**Let's looks into dataset and categories of it:** <br></br>

**About Dataset**: <br>
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. <br>

# Please go through this link to know about all categories or classes.

**Columns**: <br>

age: age of primary beneficiary <br>

sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male <br>

bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9 <br>

children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents <br>

smoker: Smoking <br>

region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest. <br>

charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance. <br></br>

**What is a TensorFlow?** <br></br>

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. It was developed by the Google Brain team for Google's internal use in research and production. <br></br>

**What is a Regression?** <br></br>

Regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Linear regression is the most common form of this technique. <br></br>

**Important Note: Before Jumping to the code go through this git hub link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/master/insurance.csv to learn about the dataset.**
